## What
We are excited to announce developement of **ID.Butnz** a.k.a. **ID.Buttons** open source project that will bring back the option of physical button controls for select functions in VW's MEB platform. Initially designed for VW ID.4 electric vehicle, it will make it simpler to control specific car functions with physical buttons. Button functions can be either assigned to a specific car function (like heated seat stage 1) or to set of functions - we call them macros - like seat heater 1, steering wheel heating 2. The next level are smart macros, that automatically activated based on the vehicle state (like in reverse, switch to wide-angle camera). And much more.

## Why
While some manufacturers and brands are moving back to dedicated buttons for the driver, VW is going the direction of less buttons and more touch screen controls. This serves great the un-cluttered design of the interior, but may lead to some difficulties for driver and passangers trying to set or adjust basic car convnience features. For example setting desired strenght of seat heater leads to fiddling with screens, double-tapping touch controls and in most cases not being able to set the desired intensinty on the first try. This means more delay before driving or even worse less attention to road while driving. 

## When
We have started with design and prototyping and expect to have working code by the end of summer.

## What's next
Let us know if the ID.Butnz interest you and what kind of functions you would like to be able to control.
