## What
We are excited to announce developement of **ID.Buttons** a.k.a. **ID.Btnz** open source project that will bring back the option of physical button controls for select functions in VW's MEB platform. Initially designed for VW ID.4 electric vehicle, it will make it simpler to control specific car functions with physical buttons. ID.Buttons can be either assigned to a specific car function (like heated seat stage 2) or to set of multiple functions - we call them macros - like seat heater 1, steering wheel heating 2. The next level are smart macros, that activate different function based on the vehicle state (e.g. in reverse ->  switch to wide-angle camera). And much more.

## Why
While some manufacturers and brands are moving back to dedicated buttons for the driver, VW is going the direction of less buttons and more touch screen controls. This serves great the un-cluttered design of the interior, but may lead to some difficulties for the driver and the passangers trying to set or adjust basic car convnience features. For example setting desired strenght of seat heater leads to fiddling with screens, double-tapping touch controls. And in most cases not being able to set the desired intensinty on the first try. This means more delay before driving or even worse - less attention to road while driving. 

## When
We have started with design and prototyping and expect to have first commit of the designs and code by the end of summer.

## What's next
Let us know if the ID.Buttons [interest you](https://github.com/JohnyForElectric/ID.Butnz/discussions/2) and [what kind of functions](https://github.com/JohnyForElectric/ID.Butnz/discussions/3) would you like to be able to control or observe.
